# Match the Items Game

The goal of this game is that you need to match the items by pressing and dragging the mouse over those that you think would match.


## Rules

- The match has to be done with 3 items minimum.
- For every matched item you get a point, so a match of 3 items you will get 3 points.

## Lessons Learned

I was able to learn more about the behaviour of some REACT hooks like useState, useId, useEffect and useRef.
